# parsing_practice
These are various parsing scripts used in relation to ExLibris Alma record parsing projects.

example_rapidserial.pl is used to create the serials file for submitting our holdings to RAPID

sample_marc_check.pl is just a quick script that extracts a couple of elements from a MARC XML file, and has some conditional logic thrown in when I used it to check on some DDA titles
